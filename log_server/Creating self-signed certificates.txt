The below command will create a new cert/key pair for a TLS server. You only need to run this on the machine that will host the server itself.

openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out myserver.crt -keyout myserver.key

For Rustls/hyper server need to make sure key file matches rustls_pemfile loading function. 
IE: BEGIN PRIVATE KEY means this is a PKCS8 key and should be loaded with rustls_pemfile::pkcs8_private_keys.



The rest of this describes how to set up client systems to trust the cert that was just created.

cp <crt file> /usr/share/ca-certificates/

dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

Add new cert file from list.

Done 



If installing to a webserver, may want to use actual tls cert from something like letsencrypt. In the case the relevant files can be found in /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain name>/.
For my server config the relevant entries look like this:
cert_path /etc/letsencrypt/live/taylorgrubbs.online/fullchain.pem
key_path /etc/letsencrypt/live/taylorgrubbs.online/privkey.pem
