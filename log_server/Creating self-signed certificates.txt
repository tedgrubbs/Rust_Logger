The below command will create a new cert/key pair for a TLS server. You only need to run this on the machine that will host the server itself.

openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out myserver.crt -keyout myserver.key

For Rustls/hyper server need to make sure key file starts/ends with "RSA PRIVATE KEY"



The rest of this describes how to set up client systems to trust the cert that was just created.

cp <crt file> /usr/share/ca-certificates/

dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

Add new cert file from list.

Done
